Cathy Darling recently joined the group as a PhD student as part of the [UCL CDT program](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mathematical-physical-sciences/quantum/study/quantum-doctoral-programmes). She will be working on the YbCaF project: confining Yb and CaF in optical tweezer traps to try and form ultracold YbCaF molecules.

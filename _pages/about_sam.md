Sam did his undergrad at the University of Nottingham studying natural science. He completed his masterâ€™s project, under the supervision of Matt Brookes, which involved using quantum-enabled magnetometers to make measurements of brain activity in order to create a brain-computer interface. He looks to continue his work with quantum metrology here at UCL, doing his PhD under the tutelage of Luke Caldwell.

Outside of academia he is an avid baker, a consumer of terrible reality TV and was previously a dispensing technician at a pharmacy.

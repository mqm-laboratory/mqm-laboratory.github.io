Cathy completed her undergraduate degree at Durham University, where she studied Maths and Computer Science, and then spent a few years as a software engineer doing full-stack web development for startup companies. In 2024, she returned to academia and picked up experimental physics as a PhD student in UCL’s Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Quantum Computation and Communications. Cathy’s particularly interested in the applications of ultracold molecules within quantum computing – where they can be used as the fundamental unit of computation, the quantum bit – but she wouldn’t mind uncovering the secrets of the universe while she’s at it. The rest of the time, Cathy likes reading things that don’t make her brain hurt, spending all her savings on theatre tickets, and generally enjoying all London has to offer.

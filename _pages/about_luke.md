Luke did his PhD with Mike Tarbutt and Ben Sauer at Imperial College London and a postdoc with Eric Cornell and Jun Ye at JILA. In 2023, he started as a lecturer at UCL and currently holds a UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship.

He is interested in developing experiments which use the tools and techniques of atomic and molecular physics to learn new things about the universe. In his previous position he made a [measurement](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg4084) of the electric dipole moment of the electron, a key quantity in constraining beyond-Standard-Model physics which seek to explain why the universe seems to be made of matter and not antimatter.

Outside of physics he likes to go running around the parks in London and play his guitar out of the earshot of others.

This is the website for the Molecular Quantum Metrology group at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/amopp/atomic-molecular-optical-and-positron-physics).

We are an experimental group working on developing techniques to control molecules at the quantum level and using this control to perform measurements which can probe for new physics.

We are always on the lookout for talented, enthusiastic PhD students and postdocs. We also sometimes host undergraduate students for projects. If you are interested in working with us, please send an email to (luke.caldwell at ucl.ac.uk).
